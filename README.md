# rwsocket


The idea is to read the logs of my [discord bot](https://github.com/1garo/bot-karambit) and save users info in redis.

## Usage


#### You'll need rust and cargo(the npm of rust's world) to be able to run the code:
* [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html)
* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


Used as a project to speed the rust learning.v
